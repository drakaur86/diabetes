Project OverviewThis repository contains a machine learning pipeline designed to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. This project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to train a predictive model that can assist in early screening and risk assessment.Shutterstock📊 Dataset FeaturesThe model analyzes the following physiological factors:Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test).Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).BMI: Body mass index (weight in $kg/(height\ in\ m)^2$).Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.Age: Age in years.
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (blood sugar). Over time, high blood sugar leads to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.


Why use Machine Learning for Diabetes?
Early detection is the most effective way to manage diabetes and prevent long-term complications. However, many individuals remain undiagnosed in the early stages because symptoms can be subtle. By using machine learning models, we can identify high-risk patterns across multiple health indicators—such as insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), and genetic predisposition—before the condition becomes critical.
